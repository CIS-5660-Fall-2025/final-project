# Realtime Fracture in Unity

## Planning and Design Doc

### Introduction

I have implemented serveral kinds of fire and water, which are two kinds of the fundatmental elements in WuXing. So this time I want to focus on the Earth element, which could be presented as dirt and rock.

When I think of these objects, I think of their textures and interactive performance, which means the Fracture.

But in most of the approaches in video games, these effects are implemented by pre-fragmentation with Voronoi, which means they cannot act precisely to the real-time interactions. 

Therefore, I want to implement a real-time interactive fracture effect with realisitic physical reacts and stylized effects.

#### Goal

In this final project, I want to implement the real-time interactive fracture with:
- 2 different hitting types, the point strucking and the plane cutting.
- Physically and realistically impact and shattering of objects.
- Real-time, high-efficiency computational simulation methods.
- Some stylized rendering effect to enhance the effect.

### Techniques:
- [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
- [Unity Fracture](https://github.com/ElasticSea/unity-fracture)
- [OpenFracture](https://github.com/dgreenheck/OpenFracture)
- [Basic Fracture Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJMSvgcZaGA)

### Timeline:
- Week 1: Basic fracture and advanced attempts
- Week 2: Advanced fracture
- Week 3: Interactions and effects
- Week 4: Stylization and optimization
